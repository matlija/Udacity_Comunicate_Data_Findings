### Project description

In this project we had to prepare three different parts:
 * first part: choose a dataset,
 * second part: we used Python visualization libraries (**pandas**, **matplotlib**, **seaborn**) to explore a chosen dataset,
 * third part: we used a Jupyter Notebook to build a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends and relationships that we discovered in the chosen dataset.


### Introduction about chosen dataset

Dataset was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/soroushghaderi/chocolate-bar-2020?select=chocolate.csv), and the name of dataset is Chocolate Bar 2020.
